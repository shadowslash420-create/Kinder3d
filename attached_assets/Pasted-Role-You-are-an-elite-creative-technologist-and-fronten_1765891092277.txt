TECH STACK (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

React + Vite

Tailwind CSS (custom design system, not default styles)

Framer Motion (complex staggered motion, shared layout animations)

GSAP + ScrollTrigger (cinematic scroll sequences)

React Three Fiber + Drei (subtle, luxury-grade 3D)

Lenis or custom smooth scrolling

DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

Inspired by Kinder chocolate luxury

Emotion-driven, not template-based

Every section must feel intentional and animated

No generic UI components


Color Palette

Warm cream white (primary)

Deep chocolate brown (foundation)

Soft Kinder red (accent)

Gold highlights (luxury micro-details)


Typography

High-end serif for headlines

Clean modern sans-serif for body

Large spacing, elegant rhythm



---

EXPERIENCE RULES (VERY IMPORTANT)

No sudden animations

Motion must feel organic and expensive

Every hover has micro-movement

Scroll reveals are slow, smooth, cinematic

3D is minimal, tasteful, and performance-optimized
